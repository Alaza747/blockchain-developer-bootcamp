# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```


What to do at the beginning:

- open terminal and cd to the project directory
- "npx hh node"
- open another terminal tab
- "npx hh run scripts/1_deploy.js --network localhost"
- open another terminal tab
- "npm start"
